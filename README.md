In this assignment, Lily and I worked together at least for the first few steps of the assignment. Therefore, I want to clarify any accidental similarity in logic. We worked together on building the squares, switching players and setting the symbols.

I worked independently on resetting, some parts of setting the symbols and validating. In that process, I seeked help from her to understand useEffect and validation, especially on having a multidimensional array. I took her recommendation to initialize an array first and manipulate it within a function, instead of validating within useEffect.

If there is ANY similarity in terms of work, it is pure coincidence.

What I want to learn more from this assignment:
I want to learn how to change CSS within my Squares.jsx file. At the same time, I have a rough idea on how to set player names, but due to time constraint, I decided to approach the reset button, which to me, I feel more confident and it seems a little bit more doable.
